      <h1>Asking for Better Feedback as a Software Engineer</h1>
    </header>

    <p>Most software engineers don’t struggle because they can’t write code.</p>

    <p>They struggle because the feedback they get is vague, delayed, or hard to act on.</p>

    <p>
      Comments like <em>“you’re doing fine”</em>, <em>“be more proactive”</em>, or
      <em>“just keep doing what you’re doing”</em> don’t give you much to work with —
      especially if you’re trying to grow intentionally in your career.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the first episode of this series, I talk about a simple but effective way to get
      <strong>clearer, more actionable feedback</strong> from peers and managers.
    </p>

    <p>This post captures the core idea.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Why feedback often fails</h2>

    <p>Most feedback problems aren’t about bad intent. They usually come from:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>People wanting to avoid conflict</li>
      <li>Lack of time or observation</li>
      <li>Unclear expectations</li>
      <li>Feedback being given too late to be useful</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When you ask an open-ended question like <em>“Do you have any feedback for me?”</em>,
      you’re putting all the cognitive load on the other person. The result is often generic
      or overly safe feedback.
    </p>

    <p>If you want better feedback, you need to <strong>ask better questions</strong>.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>A simple framework: three questions</h2>

    <p>Instead of asking for feedback in general, try asking these three questions:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>What am I doing well?</strong></li>
      <li><strong>What could I do more of?</strong></li>
      <li><strong>What should I stop doing?</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>These questions work because they are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Specific without being confrontational</li>
      <li>Balanced (strengths and gaps)</li>
      <li>Focused on behavior, not personality</li>
    </ul>

    <p>They also make it much easier for the other person to respond honestly.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>How to use the questions effectively</h2>

    <p>The questions themselves matter — but <em>how</em> you ask them matters just as much.</p>

    <h3>Anchor them to a concrete moment</h3>

    <p>Feedback is most useful when it’s tied to something specific.</p>

    <p>For example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>After a project</li>
      <li>After a design review</li>
      <li>After a sprint or release</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Instead of asking in the abstract, you might say:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “After that design review, what’s something I did well, something I could do more of,
        and something I should stop doing?”
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <hr />

    <h3>Ask in a 1:1 setting</h3>

    <p>
      People are far more candid in private than in group settings. A 1:1 conversation signals
      that you’re genuinely open to feedback, not performing receptiveness.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h3>Listen without defending</h3>

    <p>This is the hardest part.</p>

    <p>
      If you argue with the feedback, explain it away, or immediately justify your choices,
      you teach the other person that giving you feedback is risky.
    </p>

    <p>
      You don’t have to agree with every piece of feedback — but you <em>do</em> need to fully
      hear it before evaluating it.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Why this matters for career growth</h2>

    <p>Career growth depends on feedback loops.</p>

    <p>
      If your feedback loop is vague or delayed, growth slows down — even if you’re working hard.
    </p>

    <p>By asking more intentional questions, you:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Reduce ambiguity</li>
      <li>Surface expectations earlier</li>
      <li>Show maturity and self-awareness</li>
      <li>Make it easier for managers and peers to help you grow</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Over time, this leads to clearer conversations about scope, impact, and readiness for the next level.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>A small challenge</h2>

    <p>This week, ask <strong>one person you trust</strong> these three questions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What am I doing well?</li>
      <li>What could I do more of?</li>
      <li>What should I stop doing?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Write down what you hear. Don’t debate it. Look for patterns.</p>

    <p>That reflection is where growth starts.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>
      In the next episode, I break down how expectations change across software engineering levels —
      and why understanding those expectations makes feedback far more useful.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to grow intentionally, learning how to ask for — and process — feedback is one of the
      highest-leverage skills you can build.

      <h1>Understanding Software Engineering Levels and Expectations</h1>
    </header>

    <p>One of the most common sources of frustration in a software engineering career isn’t lack of skill.</p>

    <p>It’s <strong>unclear expectations</strong>.</p>

    <p>
      Engineers often feel like they’re doing the right work but receiving confusing feedback, getting passed over for promotion,
      or being told they’re “not quite there yet” without a clear explanation of why. In many cases, the problem isn’t performance —
      it’s misalignment between <em>how an engineer sees their role</em> and <em>how that role is being evaluated</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This post builds on the first episode about asking for better feedback and focuses on a related question:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><em>What are you actually expected to optimize for at each level of software engineering?</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <hr />

    <h2>Expectations aren’t precise — they’re fuzzy</h2>

    <p>We often talk about engineering levels as if they’re crisp, clearly defined checklists.</p>

    <p>In reality, they’re closer to <strong>distributions than single points</strong>.</p>

    <p>A useful mental model is to think of levels like <strong>box-and-whisker plots</strong>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>There’s a range of expectations at each level</li>
      <li>There’s overlap between adjacent levels</li>
      <li>People often operate in the “whiskers,” not the median</li>
    </ul>

    <p>That overlap is where most confusion — and growth — happens.</p>

    <p>
      Being in the overlap doesn’t mean you’re failing. It usually means you’re stretching into the next set of expectations
      while still being evaluated on your current role.
    </p>

    <p>
      Understanding that fuzziness is the first step toward better self-awareness and more productive feedback conversations.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Level-by-level expectations</h2>

    <p>
      Rather than treating levels as exhaustive job descriptions, it’s more helpful to understand the
      <strong>primary expectation each level is optimizing for</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>Below is a simplified, pattern-based view that holds across many organizations.</p>

    <hr />

    <h3>Entry-Level Software Engineer</h3>

    <p><strong>Primary focus:</strong> Learning and execution</p>

    <p>
      At this level, the expectation is not independence or architectural leadership. It’s about building a foundation.
    </p>

    <p>Feedback tends to focus on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Writing correct, maintainable code</li>
      <li>Learning tools, systems, and workflows</li>
      <li>Asking questions early and clearly</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Self-awareness check:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>Do I recognize gaps in my understanding and ask for help before they become problems?</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <hr />

    <h3>Software Engineer II</h3>

    <p><strong>Primary focus:</strong> Ownership</p>

    <p>Mid-level engineers are expected to take responsibility for their work end-to-end.</p>

    <p>Feedback often centers on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reliability and follow-through</li>
      <li>Communicating progress and risks</li>
      <li>Delivering features without constant oversight</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Self-awareness check:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>Can my team trust me to own and deliver work independently?</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <hr />

    <h3>Senior Software Engineer</h3>

    <p><strong>Primary focus:</strong> Leverage</p>

    <p>
      Senior engineers are evaluated less on how much code they write and more on the impact of their decisions.
    </p>

    <p>Feedback usually touches on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Design quality and tradeoffs</li>
      <li>Reducing future work for the team</li>
      <li>Mentoring and influencing others</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Self-awareness check:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>Am I multiplying the effectiveness of the team, or just completing my own tickets?</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <hr />

    <h3>Staff Software Engineer</h3>

    <p><strong>Primary focus:</strong> Direction</p>

    <p>
      Staff engineers operate in ambiguity and help teams move forward when the path isn’t clear.
    </p>

    <p>Feedback often focuses on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Creating clarity across teams</li>
      <li>Aligning technical decisions with business needs</li>
      <li>Leading without formal authority</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Self-awareness check:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>Do people come to me when problems are unclear or cross team boundaries?</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <hr />

    <h3>Engineering Manager</h3>

    <p><strong>Primary focus:</strong> Outcomes through others</p>

    <p>
      Engineering managers are no longer evaluated on personal output. Their effectiveness is reflected in their team.
    </p>

    <p>Feedback typically emphasizes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Team growth and engagement</li>
      <li>Quality of decisions and prioritization</li>
      <li>Coaching, feedback, and communication</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Self-awareness check:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>Is the team stronger and more effective because of how I lead?</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <hr />

    <h2>Why expectations and feedback are tightly connected</h2>

    <p>
      Feedback often feels vague or unfair when you don’t know which expectations you’re being evaluated against.
    </p>

    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A senior engineer asking, <em>“How’s my code?”</em> may be asking a lower-level question than their role demands.
      </li>
      <li>
        A mid-level engineer being told to “think bigger” may actually be receiving feedback about ownership or impact.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Self-awareness means understanding the <strong>context</strong> of feedback before reacting to it.
    </p>

    <p>When you know what your role is optimizing for, you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ask more precise feedback questions</li>
      <li>Interpret feedback more accurately</li>
      <li>Decide intentionally what to work on next</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>A simple reflection exercise</h2>

    <p>To make this practical, try writing down the following:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The level you believe you’re currently operating at</li>
      <li>The level you believe you’re being evaluated at</li>
      <li>One expectation gap between those two</li>
    </ol>

    <p>That gap is often where the most valuable growth work lives.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Closing thought</h2>

    <p>Career growth isn’t about perfectly matching a checklist.</p>

    <p>
      It’s about understanding expectations, developing accurate self-awareness, and using feedback as a signal rather than a judgment.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the next episode, I’ll go deeper into mindfulness, self-assessment, and how to process feedback without being overly harsh or defensive —
      a critical skill if you want to grow sustainably over time.
