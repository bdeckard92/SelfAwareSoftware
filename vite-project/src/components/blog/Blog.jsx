      <h1>Asking for Better Feedback as a Software Engineer</h1>
    </header>

    <p>Most software engineers don’t struggle because they can’t write code.</p>

    <p>They struggle because the feedback they get is vague, delayed, or hard to act on.</p>

    <p>
      Comments like <em>“you’re doing fine”</em>, <em>“be more proactive”</em>, or
      <em>“just keep doing what you’re doing”</em> don’t give you much to work with —
      especially if you’re trying to grow intentionally in your career.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the first episode of this series, I talk about a simple but effective way to get
      <strong>clearer, more actionable feedback</strong> from peers and managers.
    </p>

    <p>This post captures the core idea.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Why feedback often fails</h2>

    <p>Most feedback problems aren’t about bad intent. They usually come from:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>People wanting to avoid conflict</li>
      <li>Lack of time or observation</li>
      <li>Unclear expectations</li>
      <li>Feedback being given too late to be useful</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When you ask an open-ended question like <em>“Do you have any feedback for me?”</em>,
      you’re putting all the cognitive load on the other person. The result is often generic
      or overly safe feedback.
    </p>

    <p>If you want better feedback, you need to <strong>ask better questions</strong>.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>A simple framework: three questions</h2>

    <p>Instead of asking for feedback in general, try asking these three questions:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>What am I doing well?</strong></li>
      <li><strong>What could I do more of?</strong></li>
      <li><strong>What should I stop doing?</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>These questions work because they are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Specific without being confrontational</li>
      <li>Balanced (strengths and gaps)</li>
      <li>Focused on behavior, not personality</li>
    </ul>

    <p>They also make it much easier for the other person to respond honestly.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>How to use the questions effectively</h2>

    <p>The questions themselves matter — but <em>how</em> you ask them matters just as much.</p>

    <h3>Anchor them to a concrete moment</h3>

    <p>Feedback is most useful when it’s tied to something specific.</p>

    <p>For example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>After a project</li>
      <li>After a design review</li>
      <li>After a sprint or release</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Instead of asking in the abstract, you might say:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “After that design review, what’s something I did well, something I could do more of,
        and something I should stop doing?”
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <hr />

    <h3>Ask in a 1:1 setting</h3>

    <p>
      People are far more candid in private than in group settings. A 1:1 conversation signals
      that you’re genuinely open to feedback, not performing receptiveness.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h3>Listen without defending</h3>

    <p>This is the hardest part.</p>

    <p>
      If you argue with the feedback, explain it away, or immediately justify your choices,
      you teach the other person that giving you feedback is risky.
    </p>

    <p>
      You don’t have to agree with every piece of feedback — but you <em>do</em> need to fully
      hear it before evaluating it.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Why this matters for career growth</h2>

    <p>Career growth depends on feedback loops.</p>

    <p>
      If your feedback loop is vague or delayed, growth slows down — even if you’re working hard.
    </p>

    <p>By asking more intentional questions, you:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Reduce ambiguity</li>
      <li>Surface expectations earlier</li>
      <li>Show maturity and self-awareness</li>
      <li>Make it easier for managers and peers to help you grow</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Over time, this leads to clearer conversations about scope, impact, and readiness for the next level.
    </p>

    <h2>A small challenge</h2>

    <p>This week, ask <strong>one person you trust</strong> these three questions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What am I doing well?</li>
      <li>What could I do more of?</li>
      <li>What should I stop doing?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Write down what you hear. Don’t debate it. Look for patterns.</p>

    <p>That reflection is where growth starts.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>
      In the next episode, I break down how expectations change across software engineering levels —
      and why understanding those expectations makes feedback far more useful.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to grow intentionally, learning how to ask for — and process — feedback is one of the
      highest-leverage skills you can build.
